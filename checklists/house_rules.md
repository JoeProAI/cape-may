# House Rules

A few friendly reminders to make sure our stay is great for everyone.

*   **Beaches:** Please rinse off sand outside before coming in.
*   **Wet Towels &amp; Suits:** Hang these on the designated racks/lines, not on furniture.
*   **Dishes:** If you use it, please wash it or place it in the dishwasher. Let's keep the sink clear.
*   **Trash &amp; Recycling:** Know the pickup days and make sure bins are taken to the curb the night before.
*   **Lock Up:** When leaving the house, please ensure all windows and doors are locked.
*   **Quiet Hours:** Be mindful of noise, especially in the early mornings and late evenings.
